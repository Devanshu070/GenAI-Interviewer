2. **Relevance**: How relevant were the candidate's responses to the questions asked? 
3. **Depth of Knowledge**: Did the candidate demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic? 
4. **Communication Skills**: Did the candidate communicate their answers effectively? 
5. **Problem-Solving Approach**: Did the candidate demonstrate a logical and effective problem-solving approach? 
6. **Confidence**: Was the candidate confident in their responses, while still being humble when appropriate?
